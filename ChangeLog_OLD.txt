If this doesn't manage to fix some things reported here or if it has some
new bugs as compared to the last "standard" release, then please notify me
immediately by email: andi AT A HOST CALLED lisas.de
Probably between 11 and 12 I (and others) started to note some strange
Tx error 0x20 issues when doing long transfers, at least on 1Mbps Ad-Hoc. If
someone could hunt down when exactly this started, I'd be eternally
grateful... (I'm too lazy ;)

Added final workaround for lockup issues in pre6. This should hopefully
work now.

7:
Implement iwevent support.
Implement iwconfig mode Auto.
More detailed error statistics.
Tons of endianness fixes. Probably still not quite finished yet, but close.
Make ACX100 USB compile on 2.6.x (not really tested yet, broken!).
Several structural changes in driver (scanning, MAC mode). Hopefully won't break too much.
Fix Makefile2.6 and script to use new acx_pci module name.
Fix grave timer bug (rounding error causing e.g. 1s instead of 1.5s)
Fix: only process those deauthen packets that are targeted at us.
Enable sensitivity for Maxim radios.
Many, many cleanups.
Many optimizations in Tx/Rx path.

6:
Add iwconfig wlan0 sens support for RFMD radios. :)
Some more endianness fixes.
Add support for copying driver into 2.6.x kernel tree.
Add EEPROM write support (disabled for safety reasons), speed up EEPROM
access.

5:
Added ACX100 USB Tx capability: basic, but still buggy full support (2.4.x
only).
Much improved iwlist support, almost complete.
Fix broken /proc file removal.
Fix firmware loading endianness issue on Powerbook G4.
Tons of source fixes with the help of splint code analysis tool.
Fix places with driver accessing freed memory and potentially crashing.
Fix potential crash by firmware loading error path.
Fix definition problem with short preamble flag management.
Software timer cleanup fix.
Many driver struct cleanups.

4:
2.6.x out-of-kernel module build :)
Enable setting Master (HostAP) mode, do some preliminary fixes for it.
Remove failed device from device list ring to avoid OOPS in cleanup_module.
Improvements for old Wireless Extensions layer, fixes OOPS.
Hopefully fix modversions problem.
ESSID " " is actually used by some APs as the "hidden" ESSID, it seems.
Add kernel boot parameter acx_firmware_dir=XXX.
Several USB fixes/improvements. Not working yet.
Make sure to actually commit Energy Detect value.
"make install" to install driver files in kernel dir and run depmod.
Radio type 0x15 is Ralink.
Don't fail to ACK any IRQ type.
Don't load radio image for ACX111 cards.
Clean up code.

3:
Revert problematic free_netdev() change (only available in newer kernels)
Update ALL files to use priv instead of wlandev/hw/context.
Fix ED value commit.
Unify some format strings.

2:
Implement setting of RTS threshold.
Add script fetch_firmware to automate firmware download.
Do card hardware shutdown in cleanup_module, NOT remove_pci.

pre7_plus_fixes_1:
Disable 802.11 power save mode for now, which hopefully will fix the
Tx error 0x20 traffic lockups (PLEASE REPORT!!).
Add proper pre7 version and ChangeLog which for some EXTREMELY strange
reason didn't show up in pre7.
Fix misplaced variable causing compile failure.

15:
README: Update firmware download version, many, many more troubleshooting hints,
add link to acx100 howto.
Configure: print out wireless extension version.
1130 support: modified includes.
Makefile: clean *.o properly.
Don't force a different antenna selection value on users. Hopefully this
will fix any antenna selection (connectivity) problems.
kmalloc large structures instead of placing on stack. hopefully fixes
stack overflows.
Add logging to inform that AP has been rejected due to SSID mismatch.
start_net: add parameter USE_DHCP.

14 (note: file accidentally deleted, restored from external source, thanks!!):
First parts of 1130 support, done by Oliver Mihatsch. Not working yet,
but it's a start.
Added iwpriv list_net_status for debugging.

13:
Further USB updates: receiving now works, transmit doesn't.
Silence byte dumping messing up the whole logging.

12 (the "Peace to the Near East" update ;-):
Big USB update by Martin Wawro (still no go, though: bulk transfer
still broken for unknown reason).
Add Regulatory domain 0x51, Israel(?). Fix some related bugs.
Introduce logging define L_XFER_BEACON (0x2000) to cut down on logging.
Add code for Info Mailbox reading.
Make scripts more POSIX shell compliant, don't always require bash.
Update README.

11:
UPDATE: sorry guys, power save mode doesn't work yet, probably
need to resolve some NULL frame setup issues.
My Christmas present to you: add initial 802.11 power save mode support. :-)
Activated via iwconfig wlan0 power XXXX.
Not tested yet, though.
Very small fix for ENTER / EXIT pairings.

10:
Fix ESSID off-by-1 bug. Doh!
Fix HORRIBLE bug in frame flag check, disabling several functions. This
might fix some connection loss issues (or it may just as well OOPS now...).

9:
Fix compilation if WIRELESS_EXT > 15, but IW_HANDLER_VERSION <= 4.
Fix scan list overflow in case of 802.11g stations (overflowed channel value).

8:
Change firmware upload to not auto increment. Hopefully this will fix
firmware upload failure on some D-Link cards.
Implement SIOCSIWAP (set AP) ioctl.
Fixed SIOCGIWRANGE for old WE versions.

Don't despair - the next release is near! :)

7:
Make sure to not include modversions.h in include/wlan_compat.h

6:
The Maxim radio Tx level issue should be fixed at least from this version on.
Add much more verbosity to firmware upload, since there are issues with
D-Link cards...
Fix real cause for MSDU lifetime issues, and revert to 2048 (0x800) value.
Fix problem with "incorrect" rates announced by peer station. This should
hopefully fix the "incompatible rates" association error.
Don't deauthen in case we receive a Null Function packet from an unknown
station.
Insert missing acx100_ioctl_get_range() function and add more range
specifications. Should fix wavemon.

Changelog for older versions:
Fix ESSID ioctl OOPS for old wireless extensions.
Change RXBUFFERNO/TXBUFFERNO from 32 to 16 (several people had memory
allocation issues).
Change MSDU lifetime from 0x800 to 5000 (several people reported 0x10 Tx
errors), add support for iwconfig retry lifetime.
Implement iwprivs set_led_power, set_mac_addr.
Fix wrong wireless extension version check.
Add ACX_DEBUG define in Makefile.
Add much improved Configure script.
Fix for Tx level setting tables depending on radio ID.
Some stack improvements.
Add BSS entries to /proc entry.
Some ESSID size fix (prevented possible corruption)
Fix for old wireless extension headers.
