Changes:
========


2003.09.21 - 0.2.0pre2 released
- fix ringbuffer increment screwup
- fix capability flags announcing: it's not particularly healthy
  to ask 11Mbps APs for PBCC support...
- better handling of regulatory domains:
  - scanning/association fixes for reported problem
  - read default regulatory domain setting from EEPROM
- add missing unregister_netdev(), might eventually perhaps fix reported issue
- improvements in the CardBus layer support
- make link quality display show real percentage levels, not broken dBm levels
  (sorry, really couldn't find out how to convert values given to proper dBm!)
- compile fixes for arm-linux (not tested yet due to lack of CardBus on iPAQ,
  but if someone implemented USB support I could actually test the driver
  on my XScale devel board!)
- EXPERIMENTAL_VER_0_3: doubled driver init speed and killed CPU hogging
- vastly improved scripts
- huge README update
- rename function names, remove some unused functions, docu cleanup

2003.09.14 - 0.2.0pre1 released
- "fix" major bug "association on every other attempt", by adding
  OS-based retry timer support for newer firmware versions which don't
  support a hardware timer any more
- fix short/long preamble compatibility issue causing Tx error 0x20 problems:
  we were sending packets with short preamble, although short preamble
  is only an OPTIONAL feature in 802.11b
- support "iwconfig wlan0 essid any" for automatic association to any station
  (mode Auto is not yet implemented, however)
- add support for building outside of Linux 2.6.x kernel tree
- improve WEP support: print/set open/restricted status
- fix transmit_deauthen() and other package generation functions
- add experimental (currently disabled) code for proper pcmcia_cs support
- convert firmware version string to number, add some checks in the code
  to adjust support for various firmware versions with different behaviour
- switch off power LED on driver unloading to save power ;-)
- add detection strings for some cards
- clean up scanning code

2003.08.24 - 0.1h released
- improve ring buffer handling, many locking changes
  (problematic ping latency with some cards should be a thing of the past)
- add net queue stop/wake to prevent flood ping from killing the connection
- fix some disassociation problems / connection hangup
- recognize IPv6 broadcast address properly
- print more card details, add DrayTek Vigor 520 ID
- small Linux 2.6.x fix

2003.08.16 - 0.1g released
- fix state management
  this also fixes the multi-second pings
- fix WEP operation
- fix ifup/ifdown/ifup broken interrupt reinitialisation
- fix gcc 2.95.4 compile issues
- fix crash when loading 0 length firmware file
- fix net queue problems when not associated yet
- log association response status in human-readable form
- replace several CPU burning loops by proper scheduling
- more detailed EEPROM card ID check
- add possibility to compile out logging code

2003.08.13 - 0.1f released
- completely new firmware handling code: loading of newest Windows firmware
  versions with separate radio module support now possible
- changed logging from KERN_DEBUG to KERN_WARNING: might log to different file
  now
- reorganised the ioctl handling
- introduced proper ioctl locking
- ioctl calls prior to opening the device get replayed when device gets 
  up, enabling calling iwconfig prior to ifconfig
- completely rewritten ring buffer management
- stack overflow fixes
- fix reversed Tx power
- MAC address is now initialised correctly
- first attempts to handle APs with hidden SSID
- added ioctls for retry limit setting
- correct packet timestamp logging
- removed irq disabling
- removed all the small ctl* functions

2003.07.26 - 0.1e released
- implement net device statistics
- fix device name allocation, add module parameter use_eth_name to use
  ethX instead
- fix broken Capability requesting
- manage kernel net queue properly to prevent the kernel from sending
  packets before we're fully associated
- experimental Linux 2.6.x support (mucho thanks to Andreas Schultz!)
- disable WEP decryption for WLAN monitoring to be able to monitor
  foreign traffic
- when associating, prefer stations sitting on the same channel as our card
- add PCI device ID for newer ACX100 version

2003.07.22 - 0.1d released
- fix IRQ handling enabling for CardBus cards (doh!)
- fix problematic LLC length calculation
- implement iwprivs for 802.11 CCA and ED values and regulatory domain setting
- print firmware version and radio type on init
- fix strange uninitialised reg. domain problem on DWL-650+
- kill CPU burning loop causing sound skips during card init
- some smaller fixes

2003.07.19 - 0.1c released
- fixed infrastructure association issues
- implemented/fixed/improved WEP handling
- fix card init: CardBus cards; SS1021 detection
- much improved iwconfig/iwpriv support
- implement experimental monitor mode
- better (hopefully!) ring buffer management
- fix stack overflow
