=== ACX100 notes ===

=== ACX100 firmware versions ===

1.5.0 (original Linux firmware):
  Combined firmware (includes support for some radio types).
  Nothing known so far.

1.5.2, 040312:
  Reported to not work currently.

1.8.3, 040312:
  Card works almost excellent (one kick is needed).
  Tx error 0x20 like in 1.9.x firmware versions.

1.9.3.e:
  Works relatively ok, but some Tx error 0x20 issues suspected,
  and periodic transfer stalls sometimes (or is it a driver issue?).
  Also, the connection sometimes hangs completely (frequently complained about).

1.9.4.7:
  Nothing known so far.

1.9.8.b (from dwl520+_drivers_307.zip):
  Perfect transfer (PheeNet WL-0022), everything ok so far.
  Hmm, not so sure: my mini-PCI card has frequent radio lockups which can
  be fixed by an ENABLE_TX or ENABLE_RX cmd - not sure yet whether it's caused
  by the firmware, though.

=== ACX111 (TNETW1130) notes ===

The USR5410 needs FW1130.BIN (e.g. md5sum d5147672b1e00ba61d0eff24c064bfe9),
NOT TIACX111.BIN.

Xterasys XN-2522g *only* works with FwRad16.bin and dwl-g650+_drv_v1.0.bin
(rename or symlink one of them to TIACX111.BIN).

=== ACX111 firmware versions ===

0.1.0.11 (TIACX111.BIN,
ftp://ftp.dlink.co.uk/wireless/dwl-g650+_rev_Ax/dwl-g650+_drv_v1.0.zip):
  Summary: Problematic.
  Works at least with DWL-G650+ HW/B1 (see above).
  050311: the radio recalibration which our driver does tends to lock up the
  firmware after some time (no IRQs coming through any more), so you're
  strongly advised to NOT use this firmware version. I will try to modify our
  driver somehow to make it not lock up, but I'm not convinced it will work.

0.4.11.4 (FwRad16.bin, size 76208):
  Reported to work with German Reichelt noname card.

1.2.0.30 (FwRad16.bin, http://www.ovislink.nl/WL8000.zip):
  Works at least with DWL-G650+ HW/B1 (see above).

1.2.1.34 (Netgear Germany beta firmware 1.2B4, 20050310):
7c2119a67417fe9090907c0b26483667  FW1130.BIN	76568
fcd07de4b25e1d2aaf3b78b27c5b7ee9  FwRad16.bin	83320
8a16b8e085d1ada13abc65305b59a6e5  FwRad17.bin	84912
nothing known yet, but they added support for WPA (NOTE: we don't support WPA
yet...)
WEP is working fine with this firmware (WEP64, WEP128)
Works with DWL-G520+ h/w A2, yet doesn't work at all with h/w A1!?

2.3.1.31 (Safecom Dec. 2004 firmware, http://www.safecom.cn/code/product/sw/swlp-54108/driver.zip):
7026826460376f6b174f9225bd7781b9  FwRad16.bin	92836
95552544ca6d2b4e8c6aeb80b8ae7fdf  FwRad17.bin	94192
a1fa9681e297b4e36e257090fc12265a  FwRad19.bin	96336
Interestingly this contains a firmware for the previously unknown 0x19 radio
type.
Known so far: works successfully with some ACX111 PCI card.


The latest firmware version (as of 041006, which exact version is it?)
reportedly doesn't work well with this driver (and a WG311v2),
since traffic stops after few minutes.
