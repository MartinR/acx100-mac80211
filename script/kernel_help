	 A driver for almost all wireless cards based on Texas Instruments'
	 very poorly vendor-supported ACX100 wireless network chip
	 (except for USB and Compact Flash implementations, which are
	 both extremely rare -- semi-stable USB support exists for
	 2.4.x, but 2.6.x USB support is not quite functional at all
	 yet). Almost working ACX111 support is in the driver, but it's
	 still not quite working yet, due to many changes compared to
	 the ACX100. This driver supports standard Linux wireless
	 extensions to a very wide extent.

	 Currently this driver still is a bit experimental. We're still not
	 totally sure about the status of WEP support. Many situations
	 should work, but it might still not work properly or fail sometimes.

	 Also, SMP appears to be problematic (locking issues).

	 Furthermore, associating with some access points might still be
	 problematic due to strict 802.11 compliance checks in their
	 firmware.

	 Master mode support (aka HostAP) has not been implemented completely
	 yet, but at least it can be configured now. The non-standard 4x
	 mode (aka "44Mbps") is NOT supported yet and will need several
	 driver changes.

	 You can use the driver compiled in the kernel or as a module:
	 the module will be called acx_pci.

	 This driver needs a firmware to work and since firmware image and
	 radio image can't be provided with this driver, you need to find
	 it by yourself (please read the README provided with the 'acx100'
	 source package).

	 The driver expects the firmware files to be placed in the
	 firmware directory /usr/share/acx/ by default. If you intend to
	 use a custom firmware directory, then in case you're using a
	 driver module, you should specify/configure the module parameter
	 firmware_dir=[full path to the firmware directory], and in case
	 you are using the builtin driver, you need to give the kernel
	 boot parameter acx_firmware_dir=[full path to the firmware directory].

	 The 'acx100' project page is at <http://acx100.sourceforge.net>.

	 You can find a useful HOWTO for Mandrake, Slackware, Red Hat and
	 Debian (Knoppix) at <http://www.houseofcraig.net/acx100_howto.php>.

	 You will very likely also need the Wireless Tools in order to
	 configure your card and to make /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts work:
	 <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>.

	 The Linux hotplug package is required for automatic setup of
	 CardBus cards and for proper ACX100 USB card operations.
