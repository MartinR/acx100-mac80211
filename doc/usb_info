This package also includes a highly experimental driver for the D-Link
DWL120+ (and only the "+" cards). 

Note that currently only the boot-up of the USB adapter (i.e. the
upload of the firmware) is supported. The driver currently offers
no functionality other than that (help on development is welcome).

To be able to use the driver, the USB core and UHCI/OHCI should be
either loaded or compiled into the kernel. As soon as the ACX100
USB driver is loaded, it will register itself at the USB subsystem
of the kernel. In case it detects the DWL-120+ adapter, it looks
for a firmware file in the /etc/acx100 directory. The firmware
is shipped with the Windoze driver CDs of the USB-adapter and
is usually named "ACX100.bin". Just copy that file into the
aforementioned directory as "ACX100.bin" (MIND THE CAPITALIZATION!)
and everything should work fine.
