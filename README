Please describe your wireless setup, manufacturer and type
(acx100/acx100usb/acx111?) of your hardware. Which firmware image(s)
are you using? If problem is reproducible, #define ACX_DEBUG 2
in acx_config.h and modprobe driver with debug=0xffff.
Post resulting kernel log (bzipped). It is large but very useful
for bug hunting. Try older versions of the driver.

Firmware images:
================

=> See also the wiki

You should not supply firmware_dir= parameter anymore. Driver will try
to load the following images via hotplug (not from /usr/share/acx
directory as older driver did, hotplug firmware directory location
varies for different distros, try /lib/firmware or
/usr/lib/hotplug/firmware):

PCI driver:
'tiacxNNNcMM' (NNN=100/111, MM=radio module ID (in uppercase hex)):
combined firmware for specified chipset and radio.
Failing that, it will try to load images named 'tiacxNNN'
(main firmware for specified chipset) and 'tiacxNNNrMM' (corresponding
radio module). For example, my firmware is in file named 'tiacx111c16'.
Alternatively, I may remove it and use pair of files 'tiacx111' and
'tiacx111r16' instead.
USB driver:
image is named 'tiacxNNNusbcMM'
